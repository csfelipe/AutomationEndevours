# Code Signing - Search and Apply

## What's up with this script?

### TLDR
Search for a git stash and apply it.

### A little bit of history
Sometimes you can't just invalidade all your provisioning profiles and start things Fastlane or change signing requirements from a specific repo, am I right? So to avoid having to change code signings and provisioning profiles in 4 different targets everything I was going to run this project I wanted to run one command and have it done. So I made a stash with the changes I needed for my code signing and provisioning profiles and put this script together.

### Execution and Output
